      <p> Hello my name is Gabrielle and I was born and raised in Saint Louis, Missouri!
        Some of my favorite activities to do are drawing, reading, learning new skills and knowledge, writing, playing with my cats, gaming, and listening to music!
        The reason I decided to get into web development is because I have always been
        interested in expanding my knowledge on technology and get a deeper understanding
        of web development. I also always really wanted to make my own programs/applications such as games and interactive sites. </p>
